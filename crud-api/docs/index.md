# Preface

In this tutorial, we will build a simple RESTful API application using Symfony and the latest PHP 8.

## Audience

I assume you have some basic knowledge of PHP language, esp. the [OOP feature since PHP 5.2](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php). 

If you are experienced in other OOP program languages, such as Java and C#, it is not difficult to migrate to the latest PHP programming. In fact, a lot of PHP frameworks, such as Zend Framework(now Laminas), Symfony and Doctrine are heavily inspired by Java frameworks, such as Spring and JPA/Hibernate.

In this tutorial, we will utilize the latest PHP 8 features to cook the sample application.
